### Privacy

Eparto Virtual Phone prioritizes the privacy. The extension communicates solely
with the configured backend server (_[eparto.net](https://app.eparto.net) by
default_) to facilitate its features. It does not track the browsing activity,
monitor other tabs or collect any information about the user's actions outside
of its intended functionality. All interactions are limited to what is necessary
to provide a secure and seamless virtual phone experience.

See [Privacy Policy](docs/privacy-policy.md) for more details.

If you want to install and use your own backend server, see
[Galaxy](https://github.com/emrahcom/galaxy).
